# Map - JavaScript Data Structure
-------
### Simulating a quiz using Map as a Data Structure

[Read the code here](./quiz_using_map.js)

Notes about Map:

Maps are a new data structure in JavaScript that allows us to store data with key value pairs, similar to Objects. But the biggest difference is that in Objects, the type of the keys are always strings, however ***in Maps the keys can have any type*** and it can gave to us a lot of possibilities.

Maps has also moderns methods that brings efficiency to it and as Sets, Maps can't also have duplicated values.

Used in the program:

1. `.get()`
2. `Destruct`
3. `Map Iteration using for of loop`
